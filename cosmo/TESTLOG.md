# Cosmology with NRPIC: test log

Rules as in `docs/TESTLOG.md`: every explanation is written with a prediction before the
run that could refute it; later entries and entries titled "Correction" override earlier
ones; "not determined" where no run isolates a cause. Times are local (PST).

## Plan and design (2026-11-13, 23:40)

Sources of arXiv:1908.05683, 1711.06681, 1904.07841, 2001.07968, 1905.08890, 1101.3555
and 1111.2997 downloaded to `refs/`. Paper 1 and the method part of its predecessor read
in full by me; specifications of papers 2 and 3 being extracted by two agents into
`cosmo/notes/`. Plan in `cosmo/PLAN.md`; working paper `cosmo/paper/main.pdf`.

Design decisions and the estimates they rest on (to be checked by the first tests):
- Lapse condition d_t alpha = -(1/3) alpha^2 K gives alpha = a on the homogeneous
  solution, so t is conformal time and the time step can stay fixed. Estimate: a = 1 to
  56 takes 2 (sqrt(56) - 1)/H_0 = 13.0/H_0 = 3.2 box lengths (L = 4/H_0), i.e. 830 steps
  at 64 cells per side and a step of a quarter cell.
- Constraint solve with the particles held fixed: linearized Hamiltonian operator
  Laplacian - (5/12) K^2 - 2 pi E = Laplacian - (9/2) H^2 on the background.
- Relativistic Zel'dovich displacement: divergence of the displacement equals
  -(delta_N - 5 psi_N); for the single-wavelength data of paper 1 the displacement is
  (1 + 7.5 (H/k)^2) = 4.04 times the Newtonian one.

## C0, first test: homogeneous dust universe (23:40)

Code changes (commit follows the test): periodic wrap of particles and clouds, proper
time per particle, null particles in the midpoint pusher, additional probes, mesh
statistics in the history (proper volume, mean K, extrema), cosmological constant as a
source, problem generator for cosmological data (homogeneous, or fields from a file).
Run `cosmo/flrw_n32_cpu`: 32^3 cells, 32^3 lattice particles at rest, H_0 = 1, box 4,
conformal-time lapse condition, zero shift, to t = 2.
Written before the run: the fields have no spatial dependence, so the code integrates
ordinary differential equations with fourth-order Runge-Kutta at a step of 1/32. At
t = 2: lapse and scale factor 4 (relative error below 1e-5), mean K = -3/8, proper
volume 4096, probe energy density rho_0/64 = 1.8651e-3, probe proper time 14/3, all to
the same relative accuracy; every particle within 1e-10 of its lattice site and with
proper time 14/3; all 32768 particles kept. A larger error, a drift of particles, or
particles lost at the periodic boundary would mean a defect in the new code.

Result (`cosmo/flrw_n32_cpu`): the particle part behaves as predicted (no particle
lost, none displaced, deposited density uniform to the last digit, mesh integral equal
to the particle sum). The spacetime does not: at t = 2 the lapse is 3.682 against 4
(8 percent low), the density 4.2 percent high, the proper volume 4.0 percent low, the
proper time 4.50 against 4.67; the Hamiltonian-constraint norm rises from 3e-30 to 0.66
and the Z4c variable Theta to 2.0. Prediction refuted.
Cause, with its test. The coupling of the method holds the matter sources fixed during
the stages of a spacetime step. The energy density is the particle sum divided by the
volume element, and in an expanding universe the volume element changes at three times
the Hubble rate: 9 percent per step at the start of this run. Holding it fixed is a
first-order error in time with that coefficient. (In the isolated systems of the first
project the sources change little over a step.) Change: the particle module hands the
spacetime solver the sources as densities (sources times sqrt(gamma), which change only
through the motion and the Lorentz factors of the particles), and the solver multiplies
them by 1/sqrt(gamma) = chi^(3/2) of each stage (`<particles> source_density`).
Optionally the densities are extrapolated to the middle of the step from the last two
deposits (`source_extrap`), which makes the coupling second order in the slow part too.
The specification of paper 2 extracted in the meantime shows that its authors refresh
the same chi^(3/2) factor between particle updates.
Written before the rerun (`cosmo/flrw_n32_cpu_sd`): with densities converted per
stage the homogeneous run is again a set of ordinary differential equations integrated
at fourth order; lapse, density, volume, mean K and proper time agree with the exact
solution to better than 1e-5 at t = 2 and the constraint norm stays below 1e-8.

Result (`cosmo/flrw_n32_cpu_sd`, densities converted per stage, extrapolation on): at
all times to t = 2 (a = 4) the lapse agrees with a to 1.9e-7, the density with
rho_0 a^-3 to 1.1e-6, the mean K to 3.8e-7, the proper volume to 1.1e-6; the constraint
norm stays below 3.7e-10 and Theta below 1.1e-11. Confirmed for these. The proper time
of the probe and of every particle is 4.666747 against 14/3 = 4.666667, a relative
error of 1.7e-5, larger than the 1e-5 I wrote: the proper time is advanced with the
lapse averaged over the step (second order), whose error T dt^2 alpha''/24 = 8.1e-5 is
what is measured. It falls by four per halving of the step.
What the test establishes: periodic particles and clouds work; the cosmology setup
works; the lapse condition gives conformal time; with density-form sources the code
reproduces the matter-dominated universe to 1e-6 at 32 cells and a quarter-cell step.
The first-order error of the published coupling in an expanding background is the
first finding of this extension.
