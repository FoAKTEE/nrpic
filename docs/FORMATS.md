# File formats shared by the Python tools and the AthenaK problem generators

All binary data are little-endian. Units are geometrized, G = c = 1.

## Particle file (`*.nrp`)

| bytes | content |
|---|---|
| 8 | ASCII magic `NRPIC001` |
| 8 | int64 `N`, number of particles |
| 56 N | float64, N records of 7 values: `x y z u_x u_y u_z m` |
| 4 N | int32, species id of each particle (0 by default) |

`x y z` are the coordinates used by the run (Cartesian for mesh runs).
`u_x u_y u_z` are the covariant spatial components `u_i` of the four-velocity
(momentum per unit rest mass) in the same coordinates. `m` is the rest mass.

## Radial table (`*.tab`)

Plain text. Lines starting with `#` are comments. Each data row is

    r   u   alpha

on a uniform grid `r_k = k dr`, `k = 0 .. N-1`, starting at `r = 0`, with
`u(r) = psi(r) - 1` the conformal-factor excess of a spherically symmetric,
conformally flat, time-symmetric slice (`gamma_ij = psi^4 delta_ij`, `K_ij = 0`,
`r` the isotropic radius) and `alpha` the lapse. The table must extend beyond
the matter. Outside the table the generators continue with the vacuum form
`u = M/(2 r)`, where `M = 2 r_N u(r_N)` is taken from the last row, and, when the
tabulated lapse is used, `alpha = (1 - M/2r)/(1 + M/2r)`.
Interpolation inside the table is cubic, so `dr` should resolve the profile
(at least a few thousand points across the matter).
